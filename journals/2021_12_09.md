### Question 1
	- _a)_
		- In meiosis there are two cases of reduction
			-
			  1. When the chromatids separate in second division
			-
			  2. When chromosomes  move to opposite sides of poles of cell after separating
		- And we have two cases of rearrangement
			-
			  1. Crossing over when chromsomes align so dna from paired chromsomes crossover
			-
			  2. Independant assortment of tetrads, as in random selection of the tetrads at metaphase so we have variation
	- b)
		- Down syndrome
		- Cognitive impairment
		- It occurs  in nondisjunction where there will be an extra chromosome instead of the 2 resulting in a failure in separation
	- C)
		- Parthenogenesis is when we have eggs that develop without the need of fertilization and an example would be komodo dragons, they do this so they can survive in their isolated locations in case of no opposite sex being found, as a result the offspring would have diploid cells that are basically same as parents
### Question 2
	- a)
		- It would have one possible genotype which is an heterozygous Ff
	- b)
		- A dependent variable in figure 2 would be the amount of the frataxin protein
		- The measurement allows analyzing the amount of cells doing respiration
		- cells overexpressing produced more co2
	- c)
		- Mice and humans share the same genetic code as systems for genetic expression.
		- Fermentation doesnt produce enough ATP for the heart muscle cells
### Question 3
	- a)
		-
		  $$X^RY$$
		-
		  $$X^rX^r$$
	- b)
		- Cross 3 is heterozygous
	- C)
		- Disagree,  there is still a possiblity a hetero female would pass as recessive
	- D)
		- Because the the offspring gets the traits  from mitochondrial genes from the mother
