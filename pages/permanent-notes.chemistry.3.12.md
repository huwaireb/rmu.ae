### Wave length of photon
	- Is related to frequency of radiation
	-
	  $$c = \lambda v$$
	- Where
		- c = the speed of light
		- ~ $$\lambda$$ = wavelength (m or nm)
		- v = frequency (Hz or s^-1)
### Photoelectric Effect
	-
	  $$E = hv$$
	- Where
		- E = energy of the photon (J per photon)
		- h = Plancks constant 6.626 x 10^-34 (J*s)
		- v = frequency
	-
	  $$\lambda = h\frac{c}{\lambda}$$
	- photon to mol is by multiplying 6.022 x 10^23  / 1 mol
