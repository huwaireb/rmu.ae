- t is a lambda term that has a head (alambda) and a body and is applied to an argument.

- but the reason we call it anabstractionis that it is a generalization, or abstraction, from a concreteinstance of a problem, and it abstracts through the introduction ofnames.

- Beta reduction is this process of applying a lambda term to anargument, replacing the bound variables with the value of the argu-ment, and eliminating the head.

- Prelude is a library of standard functions. Open-ing GHCi or Stack GHCi automatically loads those functions sothey can be used without needing to do anything special.

- To return to thePrelude>prompt,use the command:m, which is short for:module. This will unload thefile from GHCi, so the code in that file will no longer be in scope inyour REPL.

- Expressions are thebuilding blocks of our programs, and programs themselves are onebig expression made of smaller expressions.We‚Äôll cover declarations more later, but it suffices to say for nowthat they are top-level bindings which allows us to name expressions.We can then use those names to refer to them multiple times withoutcopying and pasting the expressions.The following are all expressions:

- The normal form of1 + 1is2. Why? Because the expression1 + 1can be evaluated or reducedby applying the addition operator to the two arguments

- Reducible expressions are also calledredexes. While we will generallyrefer to this process as evaluation or reduction, you may also hear itcalled ‚Äúnormalizing‚Äù or ‚Äúexecuting‚Äù an expression, though these aresomewhat imprecise.

- Because theyare built purely of expressions, they will always evaluate to the sameresult when given the same values.

- As in the lambda calculus, all functions in Haskell take one ar-gument and return one result. The way to think of this is that, inHaskell, when it seems we are passing multiple arguments to a func-tion, we are actually applying a series of nested functions, each toone argument. This is calledcurrying

- 1.This is the name of the function we are defining; it is a functiondeclaration. Note that it begins with a lowercase letter.2.This is the parameter of the function. The parameters of ourfunction correspond to the ‚Äúhead‚Äù of a lambda and bind vari-ables that appear in the body expression.3.The=is used to define (ordeclare) values and functions. Re-minder: this isnothow we test for equality between two valuesin Haskell.4.This is the body of the function, an expression that could beevaluated if the function is applied to a value. Iftripleis applied,the argument it‚Äôs applied to will be the value to which theùë•isbound. Here the expressionx * 3constitutes the body of thefunction. So, if you have an expression liketriple 6,ùë•is boundto 6. Since you‚Äôve applied the function, you can also replacethe fully applied function with its body and bound arguments.

- Capitalization matters!Function names start with lowercase letters.Sometimes for clarity in function names, you may want camelCasestyle, and that is good style provided the first letter remains lowercase.Variables must also begin with lowercase letters.

- Haskelluses a nonstrict evaluation (sometimes called ‚Äúlazy evaluation‚Äù) strat-egy which defers evaluation of terms until they‚Äôre forced by otherterms referring to them.
