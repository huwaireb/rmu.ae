- ### Key Terms
	- Apoptosis
		- **Responsible for**
			- Killing cells that have malfunctioned
- ### What is the Cell Cycle?
	- The cell cycle is the orderly set of stages from the first division of eukaryotic cell to the time of the resting daughter cell.
- ### During Division
	- Cells grow larger
	- Number of organelles double
	- DNA is regulated
- ### 2 Major stages in cell cycle
	- Interphase -> G1, S, G2
		- Cell performs visual functions
	- Miotic Stage -> Mitosis
- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
  Nerve and muscle cells do not complete cell cycle they remain in G0
  #+END_IMPORTANT
- ## Reflection
	- ### Concepts I have learned by the end of the lesson
		- I learned everything cell cycle, from its definition to its stages in detail.
	- ### Concepts I still have questions about
		- None
	- ### Concepts I did not understand
		- None, Mr. Tahseen explained everything clearly!
