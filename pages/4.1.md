- ## Understanding Amperes Law
	- it is used to find magnetic field values
	- $$\int{B \times dl = µ_0I}$$
		- Where
			- ~ $$µ_0$$ is permability
				- $$4\pi \times 10^-9$$
			- B is the magnetic field
				- $$B(2\pi r) = µ_0I$$
				- $$B = \frac{µ_0 I}{2\pi r}$$
			- I is the current
- ## Applying
	- ### Ex. 1
		- $$\int{B \times dL =  µ_0 I}$$
		- $$\int{B \times dL = N µ_0I}$$
		- $$BL = Nµ_0 I$$
		- $$B = \frac{Nµ_0I}{L}$$
- ## Reflections on my Understanding
	- _Concepts I have learned by the end of the lesson_
		- I learned amperes law
	- _Concepts I still have questions about_
		- Nothing
	- _Concepts I did not understand_
		- Nothing
