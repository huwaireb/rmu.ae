- ### Infamous  Zookeeper Question
	- Part 1)
		- The zookeeper would have to know the resistance of the heater and the voltage of the battery to determine the current.
		  Using the current and voltage they could determine the power generated by the heater. Multiplying the power by the time would result in the amount of energy produced.
	- Part 2)
		- A larger resistance would decrease the current. A smaller current and the same voltage would result in a smaller power.
	- Part 3)
		- Long and thin dissipates largest amount of heat  per hour
	- Part 4)
		- Resistance will be the independent variable on the x-axis
		- while the current will be the dependent on the y axis
	- Part 5)
		- We'll  use the graph to get the value of V to find slope
	- Part 6)
		- Will not exceed as slope will be 12.6 and 12.6 / 2.5  = 5.0 A
- 2 in FRQ)
	- Part 1) Acceleration
		- Initially to left decreasing
	- Part 2)
