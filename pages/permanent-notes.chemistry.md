	- ### Known Questions - FRQ
		- Question 1
			- ### Part (1)
				- (a) _A student wants to design a heating pad that could heat a 150.0 g sample of water from 25 deg to 60 deg_
					- (i) _Calculate, the amount of heat, in joules, that the water must absorb for its temperate change by this amount._
						- q = $$m \delta T$$
						- = 150 $$\times 4.18 \times (60 - 25)$$
						- 2.19 $$\times 10^4 J$$
					- (ii) _Calculate the minimum mass of CaO(s) that the student would need to use in order to cause this temperature change_
						- $$(2.19 \times 10^4 J) \times \frac{1 mol}{6.37 \times 10^4 J} \times \frac{1 mol CaO}{1 mol} \times \frac{56.1 g CaO}{1 mol CaO} = 19.3 g$$
			- ### Part (2)
				- (a) _Explain why the diagram on the left is the better representation for the bonding in fulminic acid. Justify your choice based on formal charges. Fulminic acid can convert to isocyanic_
					- Because it puts a negative formal charge on oxygen which is more electro negative than carbon
				- (b) Using the lewis electron-dot diagrams, determine the value of $$\delta H$$ for the reaction of HCNO to form HNCO
					- (413 + 891 + 201 = 1505), (391 + 615 + 745 = 1751)
					- $$\delta H = 1505 - 1751 \\ 
					  = -246 kJ/mol_{rxn}$$
		- Question 2
			- 1  _A student claims that 2 VbO_3 contains two Vb-O bonds of equal lengths and one Vb-O bond that is shorter than the other two. Do you agree or disagree_
				- i disagree all three Vb-O bonds should have same length because $$Vbo_3^{2-}$$ has three same resonance structures
			- 2 _The complete photoelectron spectrum of an element in its ground state is represented below_
				- (a) Based on spectrum
					- (i) write the ground-state electron configuration of the element
						- 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2
					- (ii) identfy the element
						- its calcium
				- (b) Calculate wavelength in meters of electromagnetic radiation neded to remove an electron
					- E = hr
					- 0.98 x 10^-18 = 6.626 x 10^-34 J*s r
					- r = 1.48 x 10^15 sec
			- 3 _Wavelength of 510 nm corresponds to an approximate frequency_
				- 4 x 10^-19
			- 4 _Using wavelength information above what is the color of the light_
				- Orange
