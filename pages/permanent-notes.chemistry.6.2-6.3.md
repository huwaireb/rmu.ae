## Energy Diagrams
	- If products has lower potential energy than reactants
		-
		  $$\delta H_{sys} = -\frac{kJ}{mol}$$
	- If products has  greater potential energy than reactants
		-
		  $$\delta H_{sys} = \frac{kJ}{mol}$$
	-
	  $$\delta H_{sys} = E_p - E_r$$
## Heat Transfer
	- High Temperature
		- High kinetic energy
	- Low temperature
		- Lower kinetic energy
	- When high temperature system comes incontact with a low temperature system molecules collide
		- Leading to the molecules with higher kinetic energy to transfer energy to molecules with lower kinetic energy
		- Molecules with higher kinetic energy slow down
		- Molecules with lower kinetic energy speed up
		-
		  $$\delta T = Tf - Ti$$
## Thermal Equilibrium
	- At a point, the molecules that were in the collision will reach thermal equilibrium, where both of them have the **AVERAGE** kinetic energy and same temperature
