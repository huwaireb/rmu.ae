- ## Understanding
	- Rational Function
		-
		  $$\frac{x^2-2x+4}{x-2}$$
		- How to find y and x intercepts
			- To find the y intercept we substitute x = 0
			-
			  $$y = \frac{0^2 - 2(0) + 4}{0 - 2}$$
			-
			  $$y = -(4/2) = -2$$
			- so y-intercept (0, -2)
			- ---
			- To find the x intercept we set y = 0
			- so
			-
			  $$0 = \frac{x^2 -2x + 4}{x - 2}$$
			- and solve
			-
			  $$(x-2) \times 0 = x^2 -2x +4$$
			-
			  $$0 = x^2-2x + 4$$
			- mod (5,3)
			- x-intercept non-existent in this case, because imaginary
			- ---
		- How to find relative extrema
			- It is when first derivative is equal to 0
			- just like finding x-intercept, but in this case to the first derivative
			- ---
		- How to find point of inflection
			- First find second derivative
			- Then find critical points
			- Then check concavity
			- if changes then inflection point
			- ---
		- How to find asymptotes
			- Horizontal
				- If same power both denominator and numerator then just divide both as in
				-
				  $$\frac{3x^2}{2x^2}$$
				- y = 3/2 (horizontal asymptote)
				- If degree of numerator less than degree of denominator it is 0
				- Slant
					- When degree of numerator exceed degree of denominator by exactly 1
					- To find slant asymptote use long-division
			- Vertical
				- Set denominator = 0 and solve for x
				  If you can factor then its removable (hole)

	- ### Analyze & Sketch a graph of the function
		- Find intercepts, relative extrema, points of inflection, asymptotes
			- 2) $$y = \frac{1}{x-2}-3$$
				- x-intercept
					-
					  $$3(x-2) = 1$$
					-
					  $$3x-6=1$$
					-
					  $$x = 7/3$$
					- (7/3, 0)
				- y-intercept
					-
					  $$-\frac{1}{2} - 3$$
					- (0, -7/2)
				- Relative extrema
					-
					  $$y' = -\frac{1}{2x^2} $$
					- no relative extrema because we cant solve this for x
				- Points of inflection
					-
					  $$y'' = 1/x^3$$
						- No inflection points
				- Asymptotes
					- Horizontal
						- y = -3
					- Vertical
						- x = 2
