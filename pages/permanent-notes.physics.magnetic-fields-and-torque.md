- ## Objectives
	- Understanding what is meant by magnetic field force and torque
- ## Magnets
	- Have two poles, always
		- North
		- South
	- **Field Lines**
		- Exit north pole and enter south pole
	- **Force on a Charge**
		- In Moving in Electric Field
			- $$F = qVB\sin{\theta}$$
				- where b is the magnetic field
			- The angle is between v and b
			- Use Right hand Rule find direction
		- Current carrying conductor (wire)
			- $$F = ILB \sin{\theta}$$
			- The angle is between I and B
			- Use Right hand Rule find direction
	- **Field**
		- Of a wire
			- $$B = \frac{µ \times I}{2\pi r}$$
				- where  µ is
					- $$4\pi \times 10^{-7}$$
- ## Applying
	- **Question 1**
		- $$Bnet = B_2 - B_1$$
		- $$B_{net} = \frac{4\pi \times 10^{-7}(4)}{2 \pi (0.03)} - \frac{4\pi 10^{-7} 6}{2 \pi (0.03)} = \frac{4\pi \times 60^{-7}}{2\pi (0.03)}(4-6)$$
		- $$= -1.2 \times 10^{-5} T$$
	-
- we  find that the f1 3equal f22
