## Key Terms
	- Enthalpy
		- => h
	- Enthalpy change of reaction
		- => Delta H
	- ## Enthalpy change of Reaction
		- It gives us the amount of heat energy released (for exothermic) or absorbed (for endothermic) by a chemical reaction at _CONSTANT PRESSURE_
		- reactants - products
	- THE DELTA H VALUES GIVEN always correspond to the molar c oefficients for the reactions as written like CH_4 + 2O2 -> CO2 +2H2O
		- Coffiecient like ch_4 here 1 if we double it double
	- Consumed is reactant
	- Produced  is product
## Bond Enthalpies
	- Using the average bond enthalpies of the bond broken or formed, we can estimate overall enthalpy change in reaction, $$\delta H_{rxn}$$
		-
		  $$\delta H_{rxn} = \sum (\text{BE of bonds broken +}) + \sum (\text{BE of bonds formed -})$$
## Enthalpy of Formation
	- The standard enthalpy of formation is a reference value that exists for compounds or elements $$\delta H^\degree_f$$
		-
		  $$\delta H^\degree_{rxn} = \sum \delta H^\degree_{f \text{ (products)}} - \sum \delta H^\degree_{f \text{ (reactants)}}$$
	- Degree sign means standard state, same conditions.
		- Gas
			- 1 Atm of pressure
		- Liquid and Solid
			- 1 Atm and 25 deg
		- Solutions
			- Concentration 1 Molar
	- ### Compounds
		- Standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mol of a compound forms from its elements in their standard states
	- ### Pure Elements
		- In their standard states
			- Standard enthalpy of formation = 0
		- Not in their standard state
			- Standard enthalpy of formation wont be = 0
## Hess Law
	- Chemical reactions can be broken down into a series of smaller steps
	- Overall enthalpy change of a reaction, $$\delta H_{rxn} \text{ is the sum of}  \delta H$$ values of each smaller step
	- If a chemical reaction is multiplied by a factor $$\delta H_{rxn}$$ is multipled by that factor
	- Same applies for reversing a reaction, but instead in that case sign of $$\delta H$$ would switch
