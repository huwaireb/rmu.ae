## Heat and Phase Changes
	- To go from low potential energy to high potential energy
		- Energy is required
	- To go from high potential energy to low potential energy
		- Energy is released
	- Remain same through phase changes
		- $$\delta T \text{ and } \delta K$$
	- ### Phase Change Curve
		- Cooling = Exothermic, G -> S
			- Release energy when forming bonds
			- $$q = -(moles)\delta H_{stage}$$
		- Heating = Endothermic, S -> G
			- Requires energy to break bonds
			- During phase change
				- $$q = (moles)\delta H_{stage}$$
		- Temperature change
			- $$q = (mass)(c_{p \text{ state}})(\delta T)$$
			- $$q = (moles)(c_{p \text{ state}})(\delta T)$$
	- ~$$\delta H $$ vaporization $$ >$$ $$\delta H$$ fusion
		- More energy is required to break attraction from liquid to gas than solid to liquid
		- More energy is released when forming attractions in transistion from liquid to gas
		- Because we're not breaking as many attractive forces in solid to liquid as we are from liquid to gas
		- And atoms must be completely separated requiring far more energy than having to make small separations
	- ### Forces of Attraction
		- Formed
			- Heat is released
			- During Freezing
			- During Condensation
		- Broken
			- Heat is required
			- During Meleting
			- During Vaporization
	- ### Potential Energy
		- Gaseous systems high potential energy
		- Solid systems low potential energy
