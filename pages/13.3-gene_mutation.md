title:: 13.3-gene_mutation

- ## Objectives
	- To know what is gene mutation
## Learning Methodologies
	- AP Collegeboard
	- Mcgraw
	- Padlet
- ## Understanding
	- ### Gene Mutation
		- is a permanent change in the sequence of bases in DNA
		- **Effects**
			- can range from
				- No effect on protein activity
				- Complete inactivation of a given protein
		- ### Types of mutations
			- **Spontaneous Mutations**
				- Chemical changes in DNA that leads to mispairing during replication
				- Replication Errors on the DNA polymerase may include
					- Proofreads new strands
					- Corrects errors
			- **Induced Mutations**
				- Caused by mutagens such as radiation (Cancer-causing)
			- **Point Mutations**
				- Change one codon to a different codon
				- **Effects**
					- NF
					- RF
					- Unaffected
			- **Frameshift mutations**
				- It is when one or two nucleotides are either inserted or deleted from the DNA
	- ### Reflection

			- I learned about gene mutation
		- **Concepts I still have questions about**
			- Nothing
		- **Concepts I did not understand**
