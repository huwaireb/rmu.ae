- ## Understanding
	- ### Note
		- Air means K = 1
	- ### Remember
		- $$ V = Ed$$
		- $$E = \frac{V}{D}$$
	- ### Dielectrics
		- They are in inserted between plates as a necessary measure to maintain charge separation and allow for storage of potential energy (insulator)
		- A dielectric will always increase the capacitance of a capacitor
			- This is due to
		- If the capacitor is not connected to any source
			- and we add the dielectric constant (increasing its value)
				- V (Voltage) will decrease while the capacitance will increase
					- Capacitance will be multiplied by the dielectric constant for its new value
					- While the new voltage will be equal to the original votage divided by the dielectric constant
				- Electric  field decreases as its proportional to the voltage so / by dielectric constant
					- Electric potential Is also the same
				- Charge remains same
		- if the capacitor is connected to any source
			- If we increase the dielectric constant
				- The capacitance will also increase (C), but voltage remains same (V)
				- Charge will increase (Q)
				- Electric Field will remain the same (E)
				- While potential Energy will increase (U)
		- **_Equation_**
			- $$C = \frac{K \epsilon A}{d}$$
			- where K is the dielectric constant
				- Known as KAPPA

- ## Reflections on my Understanding
	- _Concepts I have learned by the end of the lesson_
		- I learned about Capacitors & Dielectrics
	- _Concepts I still have questions about_
		- Nothing
	- _Concepts I did not understand_
		- Nothing
