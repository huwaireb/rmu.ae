- ## Understanding
	- **PT** Electric Circuits: Current and Resistance
	- ### Electric Currents
		- Represented by $$I = \frac{\delta Q}{\delta T}$$
			- or I = $$\frac{V}{R}$$
			- Where \delta Q is the measure of how much charge crosses a plane
			- Per unit of time (\delta T)
		- Is the drifting of electrons throughout  a wire after the creation of an electric field
		- Instantenous current can be referred to as
			- $$I = \frac{dQ}{dT}$$
				- We use this when thecurrent is changing during the time interval
		- Current is C/s  referred to as an Ampere (A)
		- The direction of the current is taken to be the direction in which positive charge carriers move
	- ### Resistance
		- Represented by $$R = \frac{\delta V}{I}$$
			- Derived from $$V = IR$$
		- #### Ohms Law
			- Ohmic devices are ones that have a constant ratio of $$\frac{\delta V}{I}$$
			- $$V = \delta V =$$ potential difference also referred to as voltage
		- Because resistance is voltage divided by current, it is expressed in volts per amp also known as Ohm (\omega) or omega, so 1 V/A = 1 \omega (ohm)
	- ### Resistivity
		- Referred to as $$R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$
			- Where \rho is material resistivity
			- L is length
			- A is area
		- Resistance of an object depends on the
			- Material
			- And its shape
	- ### Electric Circuits
		- An electric current is maintained when the terminals of a voltage source (ex. battery)
			- are connected by a conducting pathway in what's called a circuit.
			- If the current always travels in the same direction through a pathway it is a direct current
		- A voltage source is responsible for providing a potential difference called an electromotive force (emf), responsible for driving the flow of charge (its work done per unit charge measured in volts)
		- In order to keep current running the voltage source must do positive work on charge forcing it to move from negative terminal toward the positive terminal
