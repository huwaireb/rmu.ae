## Objectives
	- Introducing the concept of electric field
	- Evaluating the strength of electric field on a point
## Understanding [[Oct 6th, 2021]]
	- Electric field lines exit a positive charge and enters negative charges
	-
	  $$E_p = \frac{kQ}{r^2}\\
	  \text{Where } E_p \text{ Is the electric field at point}$$
	- ### Examples
		- _Find the electric field at a point (P) that is 5 cm away from a 5Î¼c charge_
			-
			  $$E = \frac{kQ}{r^2} = \frac{(8.9 \times 10^9)(5 \times 10^-6)}{0.05^2} = 178 \times 10^5 \text{ right}$$

## Applying
	- _1_
		- [[draws/2021-11-28-19-18-03.excalidraw]]
		- A line of distributed changes (Q) and length (L) has a charge distribition
		-
		  $$\lambda = \frac{Q}{L} = \frac{C}{M}$$
		- Linear Charge Distribution
	- _2_
		- [[draws/2021-11-28-19-07-25.excalidraw]]
		- A surface of distributed charges (Q) and Area (A) has a charge of
		-
		  $$\sigma = \frac{Q}{A}$$
		-
	- _3_
		- [[]]
		- An Object (cube) that has a charge distribution per volume V
		-
		  $$\rho = \frac{Q}{V}$$
	- #+BEGIN_NOTE
	  $$dx\rightarrow\text{portion of total length}\\dA \rightarrow \text{portion of total area} \\
	  dV \rightarrow \text{portion of total volume}$$
	  #+END_NOTE
	- _Electric field on a semi circle_
		-
		  $$dE_{net} = dE_y + dE_y = 2dE_y \\ 
		  E_{net} = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}2dE \sin{\theta} \\
		  = 2K\lambda \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin{\theta} d\theta \\
		  = \frac{2K\lambda}{R}(- \cos{\theta} \Biggr|_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}})$$
