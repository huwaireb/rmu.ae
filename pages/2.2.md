- ## Understanding
	- ### Remember
		- \microC is $$10^{-6}$$ C
		- nano is $$10^{-9}$$
		- mm is $$10^-3$$
		- \epsilon is 8.85 x 10^{-12}
	- ### Capacitors
		- Are devices that store and transform electric potential energy referred to as || in drawings
			- Work must be done to create capacitors
			- For parallel plate capacitors we get
			- $$C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}$$
				- Where a is  the area
				- d is the distance
			- The ratio Q to V for any capacitor is
				- $$C = \frac{Q}{V}$$
					- Where q is the charge
					- V is the potential difference
		-
			- Capacitance measures the capacity for holding charge
				- The greater the capacitance, the more charge can be stored on the pates at a give potential difference
				- The capacitance of any capacitor depends only on the size, shape, and separation of the conductors.
				- The units of C are coloumbs per volt
					- or Unit : (F) Farads
					- as in 1  C / V = 1 Farad
	- ### Types of circuit connections
		- ### Parallel
			- A collection of capacitors are parallel if they all share the same potential difference
				- Plates are connected through a wire forming a single equipotential on each plate
				- $$V_{tot} = V_1 = V_2 \text{ etc}$$
			- The charge on a capacitor is $$Q_n = C_n\delta V$$
				- The total charge is $$Q_\text{total} = Q_n + Q_n etc$$
			- The capacitance is the sum of all capacitors
				- $$C_{tot} = \frac{Q_1}{\delta V} + \frac{Q_2}{\delta V} = C_1 + C_2$$ as an example of having two capacitors
				- or \sum $$C_i$$
				- So equivalent capacitance of  a collection of capacitors in parallel is found by adding the individual capacitance's
		- ### Series
			- A collectio nof capacitors are said to be in series if they all share the same charge magnitude
				- Same node / branch
			- To find the potential difference across a capacitor
				- Use $$\delta V = \frac{Q}{C}$$
				- The total potential difference across a combination is the sum of all potential differences
			- The equivalent capacitance (T'tal capacitance) is
				- $$\frac{1}{C_s} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}$$ if we had two capacitors
				- or \sum $$\frac{1}{C_i}$$
	- ### Energy Stored in Capacitors
		- Symbols referring to Electrical Potential Energy
			- $$U_e$$
			- $$PE$$
		- We can find the electric potential energy stored in a capacitor using
			- $$U_E = \frac{1}{2}Q\delta V$$
			- or through
			- $$U_E = \frac{Q^2}{2C}$$
			- or through
			- $$U_E = \frac{1}{2}C\delta V^2$$
