- ## Understanding
	- ### Kirchoffs rules
		- Are utilized when the circuit cannot be classified as either in series or parallel
		- Kirchhoff states two rules
			- **Loop Rule**
				- The sum of the potential differences (+ and -) that traverse any  closed loop in a circuit must be zero
					- Simply stated, starting at any point, by the time we get back to the same point by following any closed loop, we have to be back at the same potential
					- Total rise in potential = Total drop in potential
					- #### Application
						- When going
							- across the resistor in the same direction as the current
								- The potential drops by IR
							- across a resistor in the opposite direction from the current
								- The potential increases by IR
							- from the negative to the positive terminal of a source of emf
								- The potential increases by \epsilon
							- from the positive to negative terminal of a source of emf
								- The potential decreases my emf
					- Sum of all voltages (\sum V) around the loop must be = 0
			- **Junction Rule**
				- The total current that enters a junction must equal the total current that leaves the junction (Also known as the Node rule)
					- so $$\sum I_{enter} = \sum I_{exit}$$
			- Current is from high potential to low potential -w -v
			- Voltage drop through a resistor is IR
	- When capacitor is fully charged voltage across resisitor is zero as no current will flow in circuit

	- _Concepts I still have questions about_
		- Nothing
	- _Concepts I did not understand_
