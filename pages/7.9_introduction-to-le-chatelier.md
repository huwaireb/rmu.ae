- ### Objectives
	- Identify the response of a system at equilibrium to an external stress, using Le Ch√¢telier's principle.
- ### Understanding
	- The principle
		- It states that if an equilibrium is disturbed by a change in conditions, its position will shift to counteract the change to re-establish an equilibrium
		- This is called stressing
			- Stressing can be done via changing
				- Molarity
				- Partial Pressure
				- Temperature
				- Volume
				- Pressure
		- When we stress a system, the system itself will try to reduce the stress and re-establish equilibrium
	- When molarity or partial pressure changes, Kc remains constant
	- If reactant increases the system shifts to consume more of excess reactant and form more product, in response to stress and vice-versa
	- To deal with an element that is added during stressing and isn't in the equation
		- Look at which element it reacts with
	- Once this done less of the element will be available causing the system to consume -if the element reduced was reactant-  product to form more reactant
	- The evidence of such can be seen through properties.
	- Shift right or shift left won't suffice as an answer so you should include in detail what exactly is happening, what is being consumed and what is being formed.
	- #### Dilution
		- Adding water dilutes an aqueous equilibrium and the reaction will shift to the side with the greatest number of aqueous species
		- Concentrating an aqueous equilibrium and the reaction will shift to the side with the fewest number of aqueuous species
