## Heat Capacity
	- The amount of energy (J or kJ) required to raise temperature one degree $$\delta T = 1\degree C = 1 K$$
	- ### Types
		- ~WATCH UNITS~
		- _Specific_
			-
			  $$c_p  = \frac{J}{g \times \degree C}$$
			- Where
				- It is measured at constant pressure
				- G is the specific heat amount measured in grams
				- Celsius or Kelvin
		- _Molar_
			-
			  $$C_p = \frac{J}{mol \times \degree C}$$
			- Where
				- It is measured at constant pressure
				- Mole is the molar heat amount measured in moles
				- Clesius or Kelvin
	- ### Compare
		- More heat capacity, more heat (q) that can be absorbed, before temp increase by 1 $$\degree C \text{ or (1 K)}$$
		- The value for a CHANGE IN temperature is the same for kelvin and Celsius
	- ### Equation
		-
		  $$q =  mc_p \delta T$$
		- (mass)(specific heat capacity)(temperature change)
		-
		  $$q = nC_p\delta T$$
		- (moles)(molar heat capacity)(temperature change)
		- We often measure surrounding of system
			-
			  $$q_{lost} = -q_{gained}$$
## Calorimetry
	- Used to measure heat changes in an experiment
	- heat change system = -heat change surrounding
