			- _Question 2 Sphere Q_
				- A)
					- Electrostatic force on sphere increase as objects become closer
					- Acceleration is initially to the left and decreasing
				- B)
					- Greater, Distance increase because charge increase
					- Numerator and denominator have propotional relationship one increase other must increase
				- C)
					- Greater than,  electric field is affected by the radius, and the smaller it is the greater the electric field is
				- D)
					- The current will go towards sphere B immediately after the switch is closed because current moves from higher to lower
					  potentials. The potential at the surface of A is larger since its radius is smaller
				- E)
					- Graph 1 is correct because the current starts at a high value and then decreases towards zero as the potentials of the
					  spheres become the same- the potential difference between the two spheres is proportional to the current in R.
				- F)
					- I1 Is greater than i2 because we have 1 resistor
				- G)
					- -Q shell is conductor at equilibirium so electric field within must be zero and all excess must reside at the surface and since we have +Q at surface we should have -Q
			- _Question 3 Cloud Q_
				- A) Direction and magnititude P1
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1637808029052_0.png)
				- B)
					- Draw up arrow p2
					- Less, P2 is farther from all charges than P1 so nt field is less
				- C)

				- E)

		- ### Electric Field Practice 1
			- _Question 1_
				- ![image.png](/home/rj/Pictures/calc/Screenshot_20211124_184510.png)
				- A = B
				- They're both positive so the charge will be inside
					- **Case Note**: If we have positive and negative it would be zero outside of the smaller magnitude
						- In this case if it was +2.0 and -6.0 it would be $$ \frac{A}{x^2} = \frac{B}{(r + x)^2}$$
				-
				  $$\frac{A}{x^2} = \frac{B}{(r - x)^2}$$
				-
				  $$A(r-x)^2 = Bx^2 \\  \\
				  (r-x)^2 = \frac{Bx^2}{A}$$
				- Expand and put everything = 0
				- Use quadratic formula (M)
			- _Question 2_
				- From a single point you cannot know the electric charge on it
				- But, you can know the force direction
				- And the force PER one unit charge (N/C)
			- _Question 3_
				- Changing the charge will increase linearly
				- **Future Reference:** distance since it's $$r^2$$ DOES NOT increase linearly
			- _Question 4_
				- Doubt
			- _Questions 5_
				- C smaller magnitude is at C not D has to be far from both WITH net field to the right
			- _Question 6_
				- Longer vector greater magnititude
			- _Question 7_
				- Negative + positive so outside the smaller magnititude
			- _Question 8_
				- The question is asking at the origin O, not at the point
				-
				  $$Fnet_{old} = \frac{kQ}{(3a)^2} - \frac{k2Q}{(3a)^2} \\ 
				  Fnet_{new} = O \\ O = Fnet_{old} + \frac{k4Q}{x^2} $$
				- Solve for x
				- Answer +- 6 take the negative to produce electric field to right making it zero
			- _Question 9_
				- Positive + Positive is inside
				- Closer to smaller charge so II to III
			- _Question 10_
				- Electron is negative
				- Uniform field strength is the same at all points
				- F = ma
				- A = F/M uniform force remains same mass is electron's mass remains same
				- So constant acelerration with direction that is opposite to that of electric field
			- _Question 11_
				- Positive + Negative means outside of smaller magnititude
				- Apply previous case note
			- _Question 12_
				- Constant due to uniformity (same mag at all points)
				- **Case note:** when distance decreases force increases
					- F = qE
			- _Question 13_
				- At some point it will be zero so there should be decreasing and increasing
				- As charge approach another charge increasing as distance decreases
				- As charge moves away from another charge decreasing as distance increases
			- _Question 14_
				- If it was ++ it would be oscillatory but in this case + -
				- It would go to direction to where the opposite charge is located and here electron so it goes left towards the positive charge
			- _Question 15_
				- Equidistant is equally distanced
				- Left + Right cancel
				- Remains Down Down Down
		- ### Electric Potential Practice 1
			- W = $$ \delta KE = -\delta PE = -q \delta V$$
			- **Note** W is electric potential energy in JOULES
				- V Is electric potential J/C
					-
					  $$V = \frac{PE}{q} = \frac{U}{q} = \frac{-W}{Q}$$
				-
				  $$\delta V $$ is electric potential difference
					-
					  $$V_b-V_a \\ 
					  = \frac{PE_b}{q} - \frac{PE_a}{q} = \frac{1}{q}[PE_b - PE_a]
					  = \frac{1}{q}\delta PE$$
				- PE is sometimes referred to as U_e $$k\frac{q1q2}{r}$$
				-
				  $$\delta PE = -qE\delta x$$
				-
				  $$\delta KE = -\delta Vq$$
			- _Question 1_
				- They're asking for potential difference meaning $$\delta V$$
				- We have a V old now we need to find V new
				- Simplification: 16 - 4 / 4 - 1
			- _Question 2_
				- No idea why we squared the second charge but ok
				- we add first two charges
				- we add new charges but square second one 8 /3
			- _Question 3_
				- Equipotential means delta V  = 0
				- And in this case no work being done means  Delta PE = 0
				- 0/anything = 0
			- _Question 4_
				- ELECTRIC Potential Energy
				- Means Delta Pe is negative  and as distance decreases PE increase so
				- B
			- _Question 5_
				- Not a single idea wth happening here
			- _Question 11_
				- Inside conductor E = 0
				- V  is never zero in this case
