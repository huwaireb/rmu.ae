- ### Electrostatic Equilibrium
	- A state where excess charge on an isolated conduct will spread on the surface of the conductor until there is no more movement of this charge.
		- **Excess Charge**
			- Will reside on the surface of the conductor (Qnet \neq 0)
		- **Electric field**  $$E = k\frac{Q}{r^2}$$
			- Inside conductor ($$E_{f\text{inside}} = 0$$) is zero
				- **Justification** If it was otherwise, the electrons would accelerate anad the object won't be in that state
			- The electric field just outside the surface of the conductor is perpendicular to the surface (90\deg)
		- **Electric Potential** $$V = k\frac{Q}{r}$$
			- Constant inside the conductor and is equal to the potential on the surface of the conductor
- Conductors are materials that have many **free** electrons
