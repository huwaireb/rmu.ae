## Key Terms
	- Enthalpy
		- => h
	- Enthalpy change of reaction
		- => Delta H
	- ## Enthalpy change of Reaction
		- It gives us the amount of heat energy released (for exothermic) or absorbed (for endothermic) by a chemical reaction at _CONSTANT PRESSURE_
		- reactants - products
	- THE DELTA H VALUES GIVEN always correspond to the molar c oefficients for the reactions as written like CH_4 + 2O2 -> CO2 +2H2O
		- Coffiecient like ch_4 here 1 if we double it double
	- Consumed liek reactant
	- Produced  like product
- A is 100 C water, b is 75 C water what happens when b is added to a
- A will decrease and b will increase till they reach thermal equibilirium
