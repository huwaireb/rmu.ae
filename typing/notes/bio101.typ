= Classification and Diversity of Life

== Characteristics of Life
All living things share specific traits that distinguish them from non-living things.

Such as:
+ Organization
  Composed of one or more cells with coordinated structurse

+ Reproduction
  Produce off-spring to ensure species survival

+ Energy Use
  Utilize energy for metabolic activity

+ Growth and Development
  Increase in size and complexity

+ Response to Environment
  React to stimuli

Example: A pea plant grows from seed to maturity (growth/development), while a Venus flytrap snaps shut when touched (response to environment).

== Origin and Diversity of Life
Evolution and adaptive radiation drive diversity. Adaptive radiation occurs when a single species rapidly diversifies into multiple forms to adapt to environmental changes (e.g., Darwin’s finches).

+ Origin of Life
  + Chemical Evolution
    Complex organic molecules formed from simple inorganic ones in Earth’s early oceans.

  + Biological Evolution
    Led to complex organisms from simple life forms.

== Domains and Kingdoms of Life

Domains: Bacteria, Archaa, Eukarya
Six Kingdoms: Bacteria, Archaea, Protists, Plants, Fungi, Animals.
Order of Appearance: Bacteria evolved first, then Archaea, then Eukarya.

== Systematics and Taxonomy

Studies organism diversity and relationships, divided into
+ Taxonomy
  Naming and classifying organisms.

+ Phylogeny
  Exploring evolutionary relationships.

== Phylogeny and Cladistics

Phylogeny studies evolutionary relationships using:
+ Fossils
+ Comparative anatomy
+ Life cycle information
+ Biochemical/molecular studies

Cladistics classifies organisms based on shared derived traits, depicted in cladograms.

+ Cladogram
  Diagram showing relationships via shared traits (e.g., vertebrae, lungs).
+ Clade
  Group including a common ancestor and all descendants with shared traits.
+ Phylogram
  Similar, but branch lengths indicate DNA differences.

Example: A cladogram shows snakes and lizards share amniotic eggs and internal fertilization, indicating a close evolutionary relationship.

== Mechanisms of Evolution

Macroevolution is a large-scale changes over millions of years (e.g., new species, extinction).
Microevolution is a small-scale genetic changes within a species over generations.

With Four Mechanisms
+ Mutation
  DNA changes creating new alleles (e.g., green to brown beetle color).
+ Gene Flow (Migration)
  Movement of alleles between populations (e.g., brown beetles join green beetle population).
+ Genetic Drift
  Random changes in allele frequency, especially in small populations (e.g., green beetles killed by chance).
+ Natural Selection
  Traits best suited for survival become more common (e.g., brown beetles evade predation).

== Natural Selection and Speciation

Natural Selection (Charles Darwin):
+ Traits enhancing survival/reproduction become more common.
+ Types:
  + Stabilizing (decrease diversity)
    Genetic diversity decreases as the population stabilizes on a specific trait.

  + Directional (decrease diversity)
    Genetic diversity decreases due to changes in weather, climate, or food availability.

  + Disruptive (increase diversity)
    Genetic diversity is more as a wide range of the population is selected.

Speciation: Formation of new species via:
Geographic Isolation: Physical barriers separate populations (e.g., mountains, rivers).
Adaptation: Genetic changes improve survival in new environments.
Polyploidy: Extra chromosome sets, common in plants (e.g., cotton with 52 chromosomes).

Natural vs. Artificial Selection:
Natural: Environment-driven, increases biodiversity.
Artificial: Human-driven, decreases genetic diversity (e.g., dog breeding).

== Patterns of Evolution

Extinction: Over 99% of species have gone extinct due to environmental changes.
Adaptive Radiation: Rapid diversification (e.g., Darwin’s finches, honeycreeper birds).
Divergent Evolution: Related species become more different (e.g., dogs from wolves).
Convergent Evolution: Unrelated species develop similar traits (e.g., shark and dolphin fins).
Parallel Evolution: Related species independently develop similar traits (e.g., cactus and euphorbia spines).
Co-evolution: Species evolve together (e.g., monarch butterflies and mimics confusing birds).

= Ecosystem Biodiversity and Sustainability

== What is Biodiversity?
It refers to the variety life at all levels. Including
+ Living organisms from terrestial, marine, and aquatic systems.
+ Ecological complexes, encompassing diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems.

There are three types
+ Genetic Diversity
  Variation in DNA within species

  E.g Different colors and spots on ladybugs or butterflies.

+ Species Diversity
  Numbers of different species in a region or community

  E.g A woodland forest with 4-5 tree species.
  Note: Includes species number, not relative abundance.

+ Ecosystem Diversity
  Variety of ecosystems in an area

  E.g Coral reef ecosystem with coral, sea stars, worms, snails, kelp, and seagrass, or biomes like grasslands, tundra, and forests.

== Evolutionary Process and Biodiversity

=== Natural Selection
Process where populations adapt traits for survival, driven by environmental pressures.

+ Increases Diversity: Adaptive Radiation
+ Decreases Diversity: Directional Selection, Stabilizing Selection

=== Mutation
A change in DNA creating new alleles, increasing genetic diversity.

e.g A garden rose mutation produces flowers of different colors, introducing a new allele passed to future generations.

=== Gene Flow
Transfer of alleles between populations via migration of individuals or gametes.
Decreases diversity by making populations more genetically similar, acting against speciation.

E.g Adaptive radiation in finches increases species diversity, while gene flow in beetle populations reduces genetic diversity, potentially preventing new species formation.

== Biodiversity Loss
Decline in the number of species, genetic variability, or biological communities in an area.

There are three types:
+ Extirpation
  Loss of a population from a specific area, but not globally
  e.g Grizzly bears extirpated from Manitoba but present in Alberta.

+ Extinction
  Permanent loss of a species globally
  e.g Dodo bird, mammoth, dinosaurs.

+ Mass Extinction
  Rapid loss of many species in a short geological period
  e.g Permian mass extinction (250 million years ago) killed 95% of marine species.

Endangered Species: Species at risk of extinction if not conserved (e.g., Arabian oryx, dugong).

=== Five Historical Mass Extinctions:
Ordovician, Devonian, Permian (worst), Triassic, K-T (Cretaceous-Tertiary, dinosaur extinction).

=== Sixth Mass Extinction:
Ongoing, human-driven, due to deforestation, mining, and CO2 emissions.
Victims: Passenger pigeon, Tasmanian tiger, Baiji dolphin.
Threatened: 40% of amphibians, 25% of mammals, 33% of coral reefs (per IUCN).

=== Drivers
+ Habitat Loss
  Deforestation, agriculture, industrial activity.

+ Climate Change
  Fossil fuel emissions, greenhouse gases.

+ Invasive Species
  Exotic species or GMOs disrupting ecosystems.

+ Overexploitation
  Overhunting, overfishing, overfarming.

+ Nutrient Pollution
  Excess nitrogen/phosphorus from fertilizers, pesticide overuse.

== Ecosystems and their Structures
An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and their non-living environment.

An ecosystem has two components
+ Biotic factors
  Living organisms (plants, animals, microbes)

+ Abiotic factors
  Non-living elements (weather, air, sun, soil)

There are 5 levels of ecological organization:
+ Individual
  Single Organism (e.g a camel)

+ Population
  Group of same species (u.g bats together anywhere)

+ Community
  Different species in an area (e.g insects, fish, algae in a pond)

+ Ecosystem
  Community plus abiotic factors (e.g ocean with sandy beach)

+ Biome
  Large-scale ecosystem (e.g dubai desert)

Biosphere: Earth’s largest ecosystem, encompassing all biomes.
Biomes: Major ecosystem types (Aquatic, Grassland, Forest, Desert, Tundra).

== Energy Flow in Ecosystems
Only 10% of energy transfers between trophic levels; 90% is lost as heat (metabolic processes).
Energy originates from the sun, flowing from producers upward.

=== Food Chain
Linear energy flow from one trophic level to another (e.g. grass -> deer -> wolf)
Single pathway, less stable.

=== Food Web
Interconnected food chains showing complex “who-eats-who” relationships.
Organisms occupy multiple trophic levels; more stable than food chains.

=== Trophic Levels
+ Producers
Convert inorganic compounds to organic via photosynthesis (e.g., trees, algae)

+ Primary Consumers
Herbivores (e.g., deer, snails)

+ Secondary/Tertiary Consumers
Carnivores (e.g., wolves, pike) or omnivores (e.g., humans)

+ Scavengers
Eat leftovers (e.g., vultures)

+ Parasites
Feed on hosts (e.g., ticks)

+ Decomposers
Break down organic matter (e.g., bacteria, fungi)

e.g In a food chain, grass (producer) is eaten by a deer (primary consumer), which is eaten by a wolf (secondary consumer). A food web includes additional paths, like insects eating grass and birds eating insects.

== Ecological Pyramids
Graphical representation between trophic levels

There are three types
+ Pyramid of Numbers
  Shows number of organisms at each trophic level.

  Shape: Upright, inverted, or irregular (e.g., forest with few trees but many insects).

+ Pyramid of Biomass
  Shows total mass (g/m² or lb/m²) at each trophic level.

  Shape: Usually upright, as biomass decreases upward (e.g., plants > herbivores > carnivores).

+ Pyramid of Energy
  Shows energy flow (kcal/m²/yr or kJ).

  Shape: Always upright, as only 10% energy transfers (90% lost as heat).

== Ecological Succession
It is a natural process where a biological community changes over time, often slowly

There are two types:
+ Primary Succesion
  Occurs in a lifeless area (e.g a bare rock)

  Begins with a pioneer organism (e.g lichens, moss, dune grass) that tolerate extreme conditions, break down rock, and form soil.

  E.g Lichens colonize bare rock, followed by small plants, then shrubs.

+ Secondary Succesion
  Occurs in areas where a community was disturbed (e.g., after forest fires, abandoned farmland).

  Faster than primary succession due to existing soil.

  E.g Grasses regrow after a fire, followed by shrubs, then trees.

Pioneer Organisms are also called disaster taxa, they survive harsh conditions and initiate succession (e.g., lichens decompose to produce soil).

=== Climax Community
Stable, mature community at the end of succession, balanced between biotic and abiotic factors.

E.g Cacti-dominated desert, moss/lichen tundra.

Remains stable unless disrupted (e.g., by fire or human activity).

== Biogeochemical Cycles
They are natural cycles where conserved matter (nutrients) moves between biotic and abiotic ecosystem components.

There are four types:
+ Water Cycle (Hydrologic Cycle)
  Continous movement of water via
  Evaporation, Transpiration, Condensation, Precipitation

  Participants: Oceans (largest water vapor source), plants, rivers/lakes.

+ Carbon Cycle
  Carbon moves through atmosphere, oceans, soil, and organisms
  Photosynthesis, Respiration, Decomposition

  Participants: Plants, animals, microbes, oceans, fossil fuels, soil.

+ Phosphorus Cycle
  Slow cycle with no significant gaseous phase, moving through rocks, soil, water, organisms.

  Processes: Rocks release phosphorus to soil; plants absorb it; animals eat plants; decomposers return phosphorus to so
  Participants: Rocks, soil, plants, animals, decomposers.

+ Nitrogen Cycle
  Nitrogen moves through atmosphere, soil, organisms

  Nitrogen Fixation: Bacteria convert N2 to ammonia.
  Nitrification: Bacteria convert ammonia to nitrites/nitrates, absorbed by plants.
  Denitrification: Bacteria release N2 back to atmosphere.
  Decomposition: Bacteria recycle nitrogen from dead matter.

  Participants: Nitrogen-fixing, nitrifying, denitrifying bacteria, decomposers, plants.

= Population and Community Ecology

== Definitions and Ecological Organization

+ Population
A group of organisms of the same species living together in the same area.

+ Community
  Group of different species living in the same area.

+ Ecosystem
Community of living organisms (plants, animals, microbes) interacting with their physical environment (air, water, soil).

+ Biome
Many ecosystems with similar environmental characteristics and adapted organisms.

== Population Characteristics
There are five key characteristics:
+ Gene Flow and Allele Frequency
  + Allele Frequency
    Proportion of a specific allele in a population’s gene pool.

  + Formula
    Number of copies of an allele divided by Total number of allele copies.

  E.g
  1. In a pea population, 13 W (dominant) and 5 w (recessive) alleles yield frequencies of W = 13/18 = 72%, w = 5/18 = 28%
  2. In a population of 1000 individuals (360 AA, 480 Aa, 160 aa):
  Total alleles = 1000 × 2 = 2000.

  A alleles = (360 × 2) + (480 × 1) = 720 + 480 = 1200.
  a alleles = (160 × 2) + (480 × 1) = 320 + 480 = 800.

  Frequency of A = 1200/2000 = 60% (Answer: 2).

  Higher genetic diversity (varied allele frequencies) enhances adaptability via natural selection.

+ Population Size and Density
  Number of individuals and their concentration in an area.

+ Age Distribution
  Proportion of individuals in different age groups.

+ Natality
  Birth rate (new individuals per 1000).

+ Mortality
  Death rate (individuals lost per 1000).

e.g A city with high natality and low mortality grows rapidly, while low genetic diversity (e.g., uniform alleles) risks extinction if the environment changes.

== Population Growth
+ Factors Affecting Growth
  + Inflows
    Natality (births), immigration (individuals entering).

  + Outflows
    Mortality (deaths), migration (individuals leaving).

+ Population Growth Curves
  + Exponential Growth (J-Curve)
    Occurs with no environmental resistance (unlimited resources).

    Rapid, constant growth.

    + Biotic Potential
      Maximum growth rate under ideal conditions.

    + Overshoot
      Population exceeds carrying capacity, leading to dieback (sharp decline due to resource depletion or stress).

  + Logistic Growth (S-Curve)
    Growth slows as population approaches carrying capacity (K), the maximum sustainable population size

    + Phases
      Slow growth, rapid increase, leveling off near K.

    Influenced by limiting factors
    + Density-Dependent
      Affect K-strategists (e.g., competition, predation).

    + Density-Independent
      Affect r-strategists (e.g., weather, natural disasters)

+ Carrying Capacity Determinants:
  Limited resources (food, habitat, water)

== Survivorship Curves
Graphs showing survival patterns across a species’ lifespan.

There are three types:
+ Type I (Convex)
  Low mortality early, high in old age.

  Example: Humans, large mammals (K-strategists).

+ Type II (Diagonal/Linear)
  Constant mortality across ages.

  Example: Birds, rodents, hydra, perennial plants.

+ Type III (Concave)
  High early mortality, low after maturity.

  Example: Oysters, small fish, trees (r-strategists).

Axes
+ x-axis = age (birth to death)
+ y-axis = number/proportion surviving.

r vs. K Strategists
+ r-Strategists
  High reproduction, low parental care (e.g., oysters: 500M eggs/year, fish: 6,000/year).

+ K-Strategists
  Low reproduction, high parental care (e.g., chimpanzees: 1 offspring/5 years, pumas: 2/year).

e.g Oysters (Type III) produce millions of eggs, but most die young, while humans (Type I) invest in few offspring with high survival rates.

== Community Ecology
Study of interactions among different species in a defined area.

e.g All populations in a pond (fish, algae, insects).

Naturally boundaires defined (e.g., aquatic community by water’s edge).

== Habitat and Niche
+ Habitat
  Physical place where an organism lives.

+ Niche
  Organism’s role in its ecosystem, including interactions with biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) factors.

A cactus’ habitat is the desert, but its niche includes storing water and deterring herbivores with spines.

== Community Interactions
There are four top-level types:
+ Competition (-/-)
  Both species harmed by competing for resources.

  + Intraspecific
    Same species (e.g., deer competing for mates).

  + Interspecific
    Different species (e.g., lion vs. vulture for carrion).

+ Predation (+/-)
  Predator benefits, prey is harmed.

  Adaptations: Predators have sharp teeth/claws; prey use camouflage (e.g., leaf insects, cryptic frogs).

+ Herbivory (+/-)
  Herbivores benefit, plants are harmed.

  Plant defenses: Thorns, chemicals (e.g., nicotine, cocaine).

+ Symbiosis
  Long-term interactions with varied outcomes:
  + Parasitism (+/-)
    Parasite benefits, host harmed (e.g., tapeworm in cow).

  + Commensalism (+/0)
    One benefits, other unaffected (e.g., barnacles on turtle, cattle egrets with grazing cattle).

  + Mutualism (+/+)
    Both benefit (e.g., lichens: fungus provides moisture, algae provide food; ruminants and gut bacteria digest cellulose).
